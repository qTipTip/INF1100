### Classes

Given the following class

```
class Person:

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def info(self):
        print self.name, " is ", self.age, " years old!"
```

We can write statements like

```python
test = Person('Lars', 12)
test.info()
```

which yields the output:

```bash
â†’ python Person.py
Lars  is  12  years old!
```

Consider now what happens if we write only:
```python
print test
```
What is the output?

We havent told Python what it *means* when we ask Python
to print an object of the Person class. Hence, it prints
the only thing it knows to print, and that is the memory
adress of the object: `<__main__.Person instance at
0x1007e8170>`.
