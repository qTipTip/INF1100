### Animation
In the `animation` folder you will find two examples of how to animate in
Python. One using matplotlibs savefig feature and the external terminal-command
`convert`, and the other using scitools' `movie` method which essentialy,
behind the scenes, does the same thing as the matplotlib one. 

### Fractals
In the `fractals` folder you will find an example of how one can use animation
to visualize other mathematical concepts. In this case, a fractal, using the
Python Image Library. (Just for fun!)
